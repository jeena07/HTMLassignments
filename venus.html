        Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet and the only Solar System object with a
        size and mass close to that of Earth. It has an atmosphere, which is by far the thickest of any rocky
        body in the Solar System. Venus is the planet with the nearest orbit to Earth's orbit. Orbiting 
        inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, as either a 
        "morning star" or "evening star". While this is also true for Mercury, Venus appears as such much
        more prominently, since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky, after the Moon and the Sun,
        [20][21] appearing brighter than any other star-like classical planet, and any fixed star of Earth's 
        sky. With such prominent appearances in Earth's sky, Venus has been a common and important object
        for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy.
