        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is a gaseous cyan ice giant. Most of Uranus is made out 
        of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' 
        or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum 
        temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all Solar System's planets. Uranus has a marked axial 
        tilt of 97.8° with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84 Earth years orbital 
        period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of 
        continuous darkness.
