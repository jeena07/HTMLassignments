        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It 
        is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.[25][26] It has only
        one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.
