        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the universe where life has 
        originated and found habitability. While Earth may not contain the largest volumes of water in 
        the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water, extending over 70.8% of the planet
        with its ocean, making it an ocean world. The polar regions currently retain most of all other
        water with large sheets of ice covering ocean and land, dwarfing Earth's groundwater, lakes, 
        rivers and atmospheric water. The other 29.2% of the Earth's surface is land, consisting of
        continents and islands, and is widely covered by vegetation. Below the planet's surface lies 
        the crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce 
        mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Inside the Earth's crust is a liquid outer core 
        that generates the magnetosphere, deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic
        radiation.
