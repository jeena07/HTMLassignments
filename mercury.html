        Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is a 
        terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to the planet having no geological activity
        and an extremely tenuous atmosphere (called an exosphere). Despite being the smallest planet in the
        Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of that of Earth's, Mercury is dense
        enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. Mercury has a dynamic magnetic field with 
        a strength about 1% of that of Earth's and has no natural satellites.
